# ⚽ Premier League Match Analytics – ETL Pipeline Project

**🗓️ Start Date:** April 22, 2025  
**⏳ Duration:** 1 week (extendable)  
**🔧 Project Type:** Data Engineering / ETL Pipeline

---

## ✅ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a simple but functional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to analyze English Premier League match data. The pipeline connects to a football data API, processes and cleans the raw data in Python, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and enables basic analysis through SQL queries.

## 🎯 Goal

The main objectives of the project are to:

- Fetch Premier League match data from a public football API  
- Clean and structure the data using Python and pandas  
- Load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database  
- Perform SQL-based analysis to evaluate team performance:
  - Total wins  
  - Total losses  
  - Total points  
- Optionally export the results to CSV or visualize the data using Excel/Tableau
