# ⚽ Premier League Match Analytics – ETL Pipeline Project

**🗓️ Start Date:** April 22, 2025  
**⏳ Duration:** 1 week (extendable)  
**🔧 Project Type:** Data Engineering / ETL Pipeline

---

## ✅ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a simple but functional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to analyze English Premier League match data. The pipeline connects to a football data API, processes and cleans the raw data in Python, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and enables basic analysis through SQL queries.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The main objectives of the project are to:

- Fetch Premier League match data from a public football API  
- Clean and structure the data using Python and pandas  
- Load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database  
- Perform SQL-based analysis to evaluate team performance:
  - Total wins  
  - Total losses  
  - Total points  
- Optionally export the results to CSV or visualize the data using Excel/Tableau

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python** – for data extraction and transformation  
  - Libraries used: `requests`, `pandas`  
- **PostgreSQL** – for relational data storage  
  - Hosted locally or via services like ElephantSQL  
- **SQL** – for querying the database  
  - Key functions: `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, filtering  
- **Optional Tools:**  
  - Excel / Tableau – for data visualization  
  - GitHub – to document and version the project
